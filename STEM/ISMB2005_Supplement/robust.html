(<i>c</i>) </font></H1></center> Below are the results on the biological 
data
with 50 model profiles for values <i>c</i>=1,2, and 3.  For all three 
values of <i>c</i>
tested either 9 or 10 of the 50 profiles are significant.  By visual
inspection one can observe that the significant profiles (the colored
ones) have similar patterns for all three values of <i>c</i>.  Of the 2243 
genes
passing filter, 1255, 1306, and 1352 genes were assigned to significant 
profiles with <i>c</i>=1,2, and 3 respectively.  Of the 1255 genes
assigned to a significant profile with <i>c</i>=1, 1058 (84%) were also 
assigned
to a significant profile with <i>c</i>=2.  Of the 1058 genes assigned to a
significant profile with <i>c</i>=1 and <i>c</i>=2, 1014 (96%) were also 
assigned to a
significant profile with <i>c</i>=3.
