Below is a GO enrichment comparison between <i>k</i>-means with <i>k</i>=2
and the ten significant model profiles out of 50 with <i>c</i>=2.  The 
silhouette 
method implemented in Matlab determined that <i>k</i>=2 is
the optimal value for the number of clusters for <i>k</i>-means.  However 
running 
<i>k</i>-means 
with <i>k</i>=2 did not lead to any significant GO category that was more 
enriched than with the profiles method.
