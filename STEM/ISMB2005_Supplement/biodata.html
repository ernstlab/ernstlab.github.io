The biological data used in the experimental results of the paper is
available in two files, 
<a href="g27_1.txt">g27_1.txt</a> and <a href="g27_2.txt">g27_2.txt</a>, 
which contain the data from the G27 TC1 trial 4 and
G27 TC1 trial 5 time series available from 
<a 
href="http://genome-www5.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/publication/viewPublication.pl?pub_no=193">

(Guillemin <i>et al.</i>, 2002).
The data has been put into a format for which is usable by 
STEM. <br>
<br>
Gene expression values were 
averaged between the two repeats.  If  
multiple spots on the array were annotated as belonging to the same gene, 
then their values were first averaged.  Genes were filtered if any of 
these 
criteria were met:
<p><li>The expression level was missing 
at any time point in both repeats</li> 
<li>The absolute log base two fold change at any time
point did not exceed 0.8</li> 
<li>The genes expression level between the two experiments was 
negatively 
correlated</li>
