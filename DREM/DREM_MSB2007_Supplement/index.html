<Font Size=4>Abstract</Font><br>
Even simple organisms have the ability to respond to internal and external 
stimuli. This response is carried out by a dynamic network of protein-DNA 
interactions that allows the specific regulation of genes needed for the 
response. We have developed a novel computational method that uses an 
input-output hidden Markov model to model these regulatory networks while 
taking into account their dynamic nature. Our method works by identifying 
bifurcation points, places in the time series where the expression of a 
subset of genes diverges from the rest of the genes. These points are 
annotated with the transcription factors regulating these transitions 
resulting in a unified temporal map. Applying our method to study yeast 
response to stress, we derive dynamic models that are able to recover many 
of the known aspects of these responses. Predictions made by our method 
have been experimentally validated leading to new roles for Ino4 and Gcn4 
in controlling yeast response to stress. The temporal cascade of factors 
reveals common pathways and highlights differences between master and 
secondary factors in the utilization of network motifs and in 
condition-specific regulation.
